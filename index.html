            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
            <hr>
             <strong>Mavrovo National Park</strong>( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language" target="_blank">Macedonian:</a> Национален Парк Маврово) is the largest
             of the four national parks of North Macedonia. Located in the west of the
             country, it spreads over an area of about 780 km2 (300 square miles) and 
             is characterized by deep canyons, lakes, and dense forests that abound with
             diverse wildlife. It was established in 1949 by a law passed by the National
             Assembly of Macedonia; later the legislation was changed to enforce a much
             stricter protection system, dividing the park into three zones: strict
             nature reserves, managed reserves, and a tourist zone.

            The relief of the park contains three Alpine mountain systems: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ar_Mountains" target="_blank"> Šar</a>,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab" target="_blank">Korab</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistra_(mountain)" target="_blank"> Bistra</a> mountains. The Šar and Korab exceed heights of 2700 m 
             (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab_(mountain)" target="_blank">Korab peak</a> , with its 2764 m, is the highest in North Macedonia).
             These mountains are distinguished by chains of snowy, jagged peaks and 
             broad grassy plateaus below them. Between the three mountains extends 
             the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radika" target="_blank">Radika</a> gorge for more than 25 km (16 miles). Vertical cliffs exceeding 
             300 m (980 feet) rise above the waters of the Radika river.
        </p>
        <p>
            The park area contains other interesting natural phenomena—the highest waterfall
             in the Balkans (with a vertical fall of approximately 120 m), alpine bogs in
            the Šar mountains as remnants of the Ice age, rare karst relief 
            (including beautiful caves) in the Bistra mountains, as well as numerous
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_lake" target="_blank">glacial lakes</a> throughout the Alpine zone.
            <hr>
            The national park, the lake, and the region are named after the village of Mavrovo.

            Dense forest vegetation covers mountain slopes in the park, while Alpine 
            pastures grow in the higher areas. The various climatic influences, as well
            as the large differences in altitude are the main contributing factors for
            the diversity of flora and fauna. The fact that this region is a kind of
            "geographical crossroads" where major changes of climate have occurred 
            through history is a direct reason for the existence of an enormous 
            number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relict_(biology)" target="_blank"> relict</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism" target="_blank">endemic</a> species. Remnants of the life that existed 
            in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age" target="_blank">Ice age</a>  or in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary" target="_blank">Tertiary</a>  coexist in one diverse environment, 
            concealed between the jagged cliffs and peaks. In fact, the six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_zone" target="_blank">life zones</a>  
            zones of the park (a rare phenomenon for such a small area) support 22
            forest and 16 grass ecosystems. There are more than 1300 species of 
            herbaceous plants and 145 species of trees living in them. About 40 
            percent of them are relict or endemic. Moreover, the park is the 
            habitat of many rare plants (like the Crimean wild juniper) which are 
            extinct in their natural habitat.

            Nearby stands the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Jovan_Bigorski_Monastery" target="_blank">Saint Jovan Bigorski Monastery</a>, which with its famous

            This iconostasis is a sample of traditional woodcarving which can be found
            in North Macedonia along with the 19th-century iconostasis of the church of
            the Holi Saviour ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Ascension_of_Jesus,_Skopje" target="_blank">Crkva Sveti Spas</a>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje" target="_blank">Skopje</a> . In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gali%C4%8Dnik" target="_blank">Galičnik</a> , one of the 
            largest villages in Mavrovo, folklore traditions are cherished as they 
            had been centuries ago. As a result of its long geological history, the
            park abounds with relics from the tertiary and glacial epochs (even two 
            plant species from the early tropical vegetation).
        </p>
        <p>
            The most interesting tertiary relics are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_peuce" target="_blank">Macedonian pine</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_albicaulis" target="_blank">Whitebark pine</a> 
            , rare endemic conifers of the Central Balkans. This group includes the 
            endemic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_heldreichii" target="_blank">Greek maple</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxus_baccata" target="_blank">yew</a> (extremely uncommon in the Mediterranean). 
            One of the few natural habitats of the common chestnuts (an endemic Balkan 
            tertiary relic) exists on the southern slopes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistra_(mountain)" target="_blank">Mount Bistra</a>. Large areas 
            of the park are covered in forests of the Macedonian fir (a riddling hybrid 
            fir species) which is to be found only in this part of the Balkans and is also
            a remnant of the late Tertiary age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the Forest Reserve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasen_(reserve)" target="_blank">Jasen</a> , the park abounds with numerous glacial relic
            species from the Ice age, mostly in the form of awkward herbaceous plants 
            scattered throughout the Alpine zone. Certainly one of the most dazzling 
            forests is the community of Norway spruce hidden deep in an inaccessible 
            canyon of the Western Šar mountains. This forest is far beyond the 
            outhernmost point of the range of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_abies" target="_blank">Norway spruce</a> , indicating that a long 
            time ago it had invaded the Mediterranean regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diverse forest vegetation supports an abundance of wildlife. More than
            140 species of birds (some of them very rare, like hawks, eagles and 
            vultures) thrive in the forested areas of the park. With more than 45 
            species, the park is among the richest reserves of rare animals. There
            are bears, several types of deer, wild goats, otters, wolves, etc. Most
            importantly, the Mavrovo National Park is one of the three remaining 
            habitats of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_lynx" target="_blank">European lynx</a>. A population of 60 specimens of this 
            near-extinct species lives predominantly in the western and central 
            areas of the park.
